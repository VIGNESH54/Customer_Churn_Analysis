# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes customer churn data to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance evaluation, and visual insights.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Churn Distribution Analysis** → Visualizes the number of churned vs. non-churned customers.
- **Feature Importance Analysis** → Identifies which customer attributes influence churn the most.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** → Ensures accurate and reliable data analysis.
- **Data Visualization** → Uses Matplotlib & Seaborn to generate insightful charts.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** → Data processing and analysis.
- **pandas** → Data wrangling and manipulation.
- **matplotlib & seaborn** → Data visualization.
